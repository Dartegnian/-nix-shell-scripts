# *nix Shell Scripts
Shell scripts for Unix-based systems, mostly for Linux.

## What's inside

### Backup script
State-of-the-art, performant, Excel-spreadsheet-driven script to backup all my precious dotfiles without the need for me to manually transfer the configuration scripts to The Cloud™.

### GAME MODE™
GAME MODE `ON`/`OFF` turns on GAME MODE™ for my Linux system.

### MOTD updater
Configures the MOTD in my Linux system to mimic that of the startup messages in AT&T Unix System V because it looks cool.

### Update script
Thingamajig that updates your Linux and all the penguins inside. Written by me, for me, and probably only used by me. I'm trying my best in writing a shell script, okay? Hmph.
